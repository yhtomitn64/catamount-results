# Handoff

Where the project stands, and what is left. Delete this file when the last item
below is done.

## Where things stand

- **Live at https://catamount.burghertime.com** (Cloudflare Pages project
  `catamount-results`, direct upload; `deploy.yml` redeploys on every push to
  `main`). The deploy token is the repo secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Pages:Edit,
  this account only) and the account id is the variable `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- **Real data:** 195 races (Wednesday MTB, Tuesday trail run, cyclocross), 13,879
  results, 2,024 racers, 2021-2026, with 6pm weather for every race date. Every
  parsed race matches the page's own "Racers: N" except those short by exactly
  the number of finishers with no registered name or a placeholder name
  ("COFC 3", "Please email for results"), which are skipped on purpose.
- **Published fields** are a name, a placing, a time and the start-line group
  (plus laps). Age category, team, hometown, bib and gender are dropped. See
  CLAUDE.md.
- **The UI is keyed on distance group** (`discipline|distance`), not lap count.
  Verified headlessly against the real bundle.
- **Identity merges** live in `aliases.json` (explicit, hand-kept). Only
  Tim / Timothy Burgher is merged so far.
- **Global email guard** is installed (`~/.githooks`) and verified: a fake secret
  staged in `family-mail-digest` and in `someday` is blocked by each repo's own
  `detect-secrets` hook, chained through the global one.
- **`burghertime-landing` history is rewritten**; any other clone of it diverges
  (re-clone, or `git reset --hard origin/master`).

## Not done yet

1. **Name merges beyond the safe set (optional).** `aliases.json` holds 102
   hand-kept merges (nicknames, spelling slips, middle names) that never share a race
   night. About 11 more pairs were left for a human call, plus near-misses like
   Karen/Karin Bove or Sam/Samantha Fox. Only add ones you are sure of.
2. **Scheduled refresh.** `refresh.yml` is manual-only. Before enabling the
   schedule, add `actions/cache` for `cache/` or every run re-downloads all ~196
   pages.

Done and live: the site, the domain, the landing-page card, the event filter,
and the GitHub "block pushes that expose my email" setting.

## Known data quirks

- The organizer listing starts in July 2021; there is no earlier data.
- Tim has one 2026 row, a DNF on 5-27-26 (4 lap). That is correct: he quit
  part-way through and did not race again that year. Not a scraper bug.
